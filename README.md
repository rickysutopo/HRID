# Head Re-identification Dataset (HRID)
The purpose of HRID dataset is to facilitate the person re-identification research in cluttered scenes, where images of the full body of a person is not available due to occlusions from the other persons or objects. This dataset was derived from a People Counting Dataset (PCDS), which consist of 200 identities with various viewpoints of a human head.

## Dataset Specifications
The details of this dataset is shown in the following table.

| Dataset | HRID |
| --- | --- |
| #identities | 200 |
| #tracklets | 355 |
| #BBoxes | 21,437 |
| #distractors | 3,295 |
| #camera/ID | 1 |
| Scale | 100x100 |
| Produced by | YOLOv3 (head) |

The journal paper for HRID dataset is currently under review. The full dataset and model will be released here upon completion of the review.
